# Explanation

You have been provided with some raw HTML for the homepage of an imaginary
community college, plus some CSS that styles the page into a two column layout
and provides some other rudimentary styling. You are to write your CSS additions
below the comment at the bottom of the CSS file, to make sure it is easy to mark
the bits you have done. Don't worry if some of the selectors are repetitious;
we'll let you off in this instance.

## Fonts

First of all, download a couple of free-to-use fonts. Because this is a college,
the fonts should be chosen to give the page a fairly serious, formal,
trustworthy feel â€” a serif site-wide font for the general text body, coupled
with sans-serif or slab serif for the headings might be nice.

Use a suitable service to generate bulletproof @font-face code for these two fonts.

Apply your body font to the whole page, and your heading font to your headings.

## General text styling

Give the page a site-wide `font-size` of `10px`.

Give your headings and other element types appropriate font-sizes defined using a suitable relative unit.

Give your body text a suitable `line-height`.

Center your top level heading on the page.

Give your headings a little bit of `letter-spacing` to make them not too too squashed, and allow the letters to breathe a bit.

Give your body text some `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing`, as appropriate.

Give the first paragraph after each heading in the `<section>` a little bit of text-indentation, say `20px`.

## Links

Give the link, visited, focus, and hover states some colors that go with the color of the horizontal bars at the top and bottom of the page.

Make it so that links are underlined by default, but when you hover or focus them, the underline disappears.

Remove the default focus outline from ALL the links on the page.

Make it so that external links have the external link icon inserted next to them. (image: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/css/styling-text/typesetting-a-homepage-start/external-link-52.png)

## Lists

Make sure the spacing of your lists and list items works well with the styling of the overall page. Each list item should have the same line-height as a paragraph line, and each list should have the same spacing at its top and bottom as you have between paragraphs.

Give your list items a nice bullet, appropriate for the design of the page. It is up to you whether you choose a custom bullet image or something else.

## Navigation menu

Style your navigation menu so that it has an appropriate look for the look and feel for the page.

Also provide a hover state for the menu items.

## Hints and tips

You don't need to edit the HTML in any way for this exercise.

You don't necessarily have to make the nav menu look like buttons, but it needs
to be a bit taller so that it doesn't look silly on the side of the page; also
remember that you need to make this one a vertical nav menu.
